   The true strength of this achievement, however, lies in the collective effort of the afore mentioned class. Their invaluable contributions, marked by unwavering dedication and a spirit of collaboration have propelled this project to its remarkable success. Each member of this class has played an integral role, and their names deserve to be etched in the annals of history alongside the DHRUVA reactor. <br><br>
    
    It is with immense pride that I acknowledge the profound impact this exceptional class has had on this venture. Their unwavering commitment, tenacity and innovative thinking have been the driving force behind this monumental breakthrough. This achievement is not only a testament to their individual brilliance but also a reflection of the strength that can be harnessed when a team works together towards a common goal. <br><br>
    
   As we celebrate this triumph, let us also recognize the countless hours of hard work, the late nights, the setbacks and the triumphs that have led us to this moment. This achievement is not just a victory for science, but a testament to the power of human ingenuity and determination. <br><br>
    
    Once again, congratulations to Dr. Chaturvedi, Professor Vijay Singh, Ayesha, Adrij Ranjan, and their entire class. Your extraordinary efforts have not only advanced the boundaries of nuclear technology but have also served as an inspiration to us all. <br><br>
